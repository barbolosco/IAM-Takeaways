# PKCE

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is an extension to the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow designed to improve the security of authorization code exchanges. It mitigates the risk of authorization code theft by introducing a **verifier** and a **code challenge**, which together prevent unauthorized applications from obtaining access tokens even if they steal the authorization code.

#### Understanding the Problem

In the traditional Authorization Code Flow, an authorization code is generated by the authorization server and sent back to the client application after successful user authentication. This code is then exchanged for an access token, which grants the client access to user resources on the resource server. However, if this authorization code is intercepted by a malicious application, it can be used to impersonate the legitimate application and gain unauthorized access to user resources.

#### How PKCE Works

1. **Client Generates Verifier and Code Challenge:**
   * The client application generates a random secret value called the **verifier**.
   * It then creates a **code challenge** by applying a specific cryptographic function (e.g., base64url encoding and SHA-256 hashing) to the verifier.
2. **Client Sends Code Challenge:**
   * The client application includes the code challenge in the initial authorization request sent to the authorization server. This code challenge is typically sent as a parameter called `code_challenge`.
3. **Authorization Code Exchange:**
   * After successful user authentication, the authorization server generates an authorization code and sends it back to the client application.
4. **Client Generates Code Verifier:**
   * Upon receiving the authorization code, the client application generates the same **verifier** used in step 1.
5. **Client Sends Token Request:**
   * The client application sends a token request to the token endpoint of the authorization server, including:
     * The authorization code.
     * The previously generated verifier (hashed with the same function used for the code challenge).
6. **Authorization Server Verifies Code:**
   * The authorization server verifies the code.
   * It then calculates the code challenge based on the received verifier using the same cryptographic function.
   * Finally, it compares the calculated code challenge with the one received during the initial authorization request.
7. **Access Token Granted (if valid):**
   * If the code challenge matches, the authorization server is confident that the request originates from the legitimate client application that originally generated the code challenge. It then grants the client an access token, allowing it to access user resources on the resource server.

#### Benefits of PKCE

* **Enhanced Security:** PKCE significantly reduces the risk of authorization code theft, as even if an attacker intercepts the code, they cannot generate the matching verifier required to obtain an access token.
* **Improved Application Security:** PKCE is particularly beneficial for public client applications (e.g., mobile apps, browser extensions) that are inherently more vulnerable to code theft due to their exposed nature.
