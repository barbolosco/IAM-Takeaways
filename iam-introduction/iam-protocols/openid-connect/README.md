# OpenID Connect

Imagine visiting a new country. You don't need to show your passport at every restaurant or shop, right? Instead, you'd use a local ID card for smaller transactions. OpenID Connect works similarly for your online identity.

Think of it as a digital passport that stores your basic information like name and email. When you log in to a website using OpenID Connect, it verifies you through your existing account on a trusted platform like Google or Facebook. This is like showing your passport at the border â€“ once verified, you're free to explore.

But OpenID Connect does more than just verify your identity. It acts like a digital ID card, sharing only the information you choose with the website. Want to share your profile picture? No problem. Prefer to keep it private? No worries, you have control. This keeps your sensitive data safe and lets you decide what information websites can access.\

* **Convenience:** Log in instantly with existing accounts.
