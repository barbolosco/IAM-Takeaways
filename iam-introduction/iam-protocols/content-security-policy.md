# Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that allows web developers to control the resources (scripts, images, stylesheets, fonts, etc.) that can be loaded on their web pages. By implementing a CSP policy, developers can significantly mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other web vulnerabilities.

#### How CSP Works

1. **CSP Policy Definition:** Developers define a CSP policy using directives in the HTTP headers of their web server configuration. These directives specify which sources are allowed to load different types of resources:
   * **`script-src`:** Defines allowed sources for scripts (e.g., your own domain, trusted third-party libraries).
   * **`img-src`, `style-src`, `font-src`:** Similar directives control the loading of images, stylesheets, and fonts, respectively.
   * Other directives exist to control various resources like frames, objects, and media.
2. **Resource Loading with CSP:** When a browser requests a webpage with a CSP policy in place, it checks the policy for each resource the page tries to load:
   * **Allowed Source:** If the resource's source matches an allowed source in the policy, the browser loads it normally.
   * **Blocked Source:** If the resource's source is not explicitly allowed in the policy, the browser blocks it, preventing it from loading and potentially mitigating security risks.

#### Benefits of CSP

* **Enhanced Security:** By restricting script execution to allowed sources, CSP significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks, a common web security threat where malicious scripts are injected into websites to steal user data or redirect users to malicious sites.
* **Improved User Trust:** Implementing a well-defined CSP policy demonstrates a commitment to user data security, fostering trust and confidence among users.
