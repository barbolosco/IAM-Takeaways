# OAuth 2.0

Ever borrowed a friend's car? You trust them, but you wouldn't just hand over the keys, right? You'd likely specify where they can go and what they can do with it. OAuth 2.0 works similarly for your online accounts.

Imagine wanting to log into a new app using Facebook. Instead of giving the app your Facebook password (the entire car!), OAuth 2.0 acts as a trusted middleman. It connects with Facebook, verifies you, and asks what information you're okay with sharing (the specific destination and rules). The app then gets a temporary "key" to access that information, not your entire password.

This keeps your data safe and gives you control. No more remembering countless passwords, and you can choose what each app sees, like just your name and profile picture for the borrowing example. So next time you see "Login with Google" on an app, remember the invisible security guard – OAuth 2.0 – ensuring you share your data safely and conveniently.

#### Why Use OAuth 2.0?

* **Security:** Protects your passwords and sensitive data.
* **Convenience:** Log in to apps easily with existing accounts.
* **Control:** Choose what information each app can access.
* **Efficiency:** No need to create new accounts for every app.
