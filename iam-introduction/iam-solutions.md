# IAM solutions

Before the advent of OpenID Connect and modern IAM services, websites like Yelp were already attempting to bridge the gap between user accounts and third-party services. However, these early implementations, like Yelp's, were often insecure and lacked the robust authentication and authorization mechanisms that are now commonplace.

These legacy systems often rely on simple password sharing or insecure data transfer methods, leaving user data vulnerable to unauthorized access and breaches.

The introduction of OpenID Connect and modern IAM services revolutionized the way websites and applications manage user identities and access to third-party resources. These services provide a secure and standardized way for users to authenticate themselves and grant access to their data, without having to share their passwords or other sensitive information.

There are many different IAM solutions available on the market, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular IAM solutions include:
