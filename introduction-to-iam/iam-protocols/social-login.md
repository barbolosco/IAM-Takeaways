# Social login

Social login allows users to access websites and apps with a single click, using their existing social media accounts such as Facebook or Google.&#x20;

It works by allowing the social platform to act as a trusted intermediary, sharing the user's basic information (name, email, profile picture) with the website being accessed. This eliminates the need to create a new account and remember another password.&#x20;

Social login offers both convenience and security benefits. You don't have to provide your actual social media password, and you can control what information is shared. If you only want to share your name, that's all they'll receive. This level of control protects your sensitive data and ensures that you remain in charge.

Of course, there are downsides to consider when sharing information on third-party platforms due to privacy concerns. It is important to understand what data is being shared and adjust privacy settings accordingly.&#x20;

Social login offers a fast, secure, and familiar way to navigate the online world. However, it is important to use it wisely and monitor what doors it unlocks.
