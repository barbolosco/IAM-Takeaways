**Quick Walkthrough: Parameters Sent to Authorization and Token Endpoints**

When interacting with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication system like Keycloak, numerous parameters are utilized in calls to both the authorization and token endpoints. Below is an expanded overview of these parameters and their roles in the authentication process:

**Authorization Endpoint Parameters:**

1. `response_type`: Specifies the desired response type from the authorization endpoint. Common values include `code`, `token`, and `id_token`.
2. `client_id`: Identifies the client making the request.
3. `redirect_uri`: Specifies the URI to which the authorization server redirects the user-agent after authorization is granted.
4. `scope`: Indicates the requested scope of access. It defines what resources the client application can access on behalf of the user.
5. `state`: Provides a unique string value to maintain state between the request and the callback. It helps prevent CSRF attacks.
6. `nonce`: A random string generated by the client, used to associate a client session with an ID Token and to mitigate replay attacks.
7. `prompt`: Specifies how the authorization server displays authentication and consent prompts to the end-user.
8. `max_age`: Sets the maximum authentication age (in seconds), requiring re-authentication if the user's last authentication is older.
9. `ui_locales`: Requests localized versions of the authorization and consent UI.
10. `acr_values`: Requests specific authentication context class references (ACRs).
11. `claims`: Specifies additional claims about the user being requested.

**Token Endpoint Parameters:**

1. `grant_type`: Specifies the grant type used to acquire the access token. Common values include `authorization_code`, `refresh_token`, and `client_credentials`.
2. `client_id` and `client_secret`: Identifies the client and authenticates it to the token endpoint. The client secret is used for confidential clients.
3. `redirect_uri`: The same URI used during the authorization request.
4. `code`: The authorization code received from the authorization server's response to the authorization request.
5. `code_verifier`: Used in PKCE to verify the integrity of the authorization process.
6. `scope`: Similar to the authorization endpoint, this parameter indicates the requested scope of access.
7. `nonce`: Similar to the authorization endpoint, used for the same purpose.
8. `client_assertion`: Used for client authentication when the client secret is not applicable or when additional security is desired.
9. `client_assertion_type`: Indicates the method of client authentication when using client assertion.
