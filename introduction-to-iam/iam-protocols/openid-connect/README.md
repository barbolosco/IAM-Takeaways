# OpenID Connect

When visiting a new country, you don't need to show your passport at every restaurant or shop. Instead, you can use a local ID card for smaller transactions. OpenID Connect works similarly for your online identity.&#x20;

It is like a digital passport that stores your basic information, such as your name and email. When logging in to a website using OpenID Connect, your identity is verified through your existing account on a trusted platform such as Google or Facebook. This process is similar to showing your passport at the border; once verified, you are free to explore.&#x20;

However, OpenID Connect offers more than just identity verification. It functions as a digital identification card, allowing you to selectively share information with websites. Whether you want to share your profile picture or keep it private, you have complete control. This ensures the security of your sensitive data and empowers you to determine which information websites can access.\
