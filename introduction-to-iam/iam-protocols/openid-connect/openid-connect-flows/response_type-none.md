# response\_type=none

The last and simplest of all, the response\_type=none:

1. **User Interaction:** You want to access a website or app, but there's no need to log in or authenticate yourself.
2. **Direct Access:** You go directly to the website or app without being redirected to an authorization server.
3. **No Interaction:** Since there's no need for authentication or authorization, there's no interaction with an authorization server.
4. **Immediate Access:** You immediately gain access to the website or app without any additional steps or tokens.
