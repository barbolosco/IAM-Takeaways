# Resource owner password credentials code flow

The Resource Owner Password Credentials flow allows clients to directly exchange the user's credentials (username and password) for an access token. This flow is typically used in scenarios where the client has a high degree of trust in the user, such as in native mobile applications or legacy systems. However, it is important to note that using this flow exposes the user's credentials to the client, which can pose security risks. Therefore, it should be used judiciously and only when other more secure flows are not feasible.
