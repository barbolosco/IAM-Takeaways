# Introduction to IAM

Identity Access Management is a branch of cybersecurity that aims to regulate access to other services (web applications, mobile applications, ERPs, ...) and protect them. Its main purpose is to grant specific access and permissions to certain people while maintaining the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the service.

IAM originated from the simple login form on early websites. From there the need for efficient task execution inside of applications led to the development of federated services. This led to the introduction of [OAuth 2.0](iam-protocols/oauth-2.0/), a protocol that allows services to request specific user data (for example only contacts, generalities,..)  from another platform. This eliminated manual data entry and enabled seamless integration and personalized experiences. Users can authorize access with a single click, now interacting with services like Facebook, Google, and Twitter, enhancing the digital ecosystem.

Up until this point, the website granted access based on the user's profile after entering the correct username and password. However, this model had its limitations. The user requested a faster model that requires fewer passwords and accounts. [OpenID Connect](iam-protocols/openid-connect/) was created on top of OAuth2.0 to enable website and app authentication without the need to manage password files. To achieve this, 'federated authentication' is used. Practically, users can authenticate using their existing credentials on a single IAM service called Identity Provider.

However, the story does not end there. As users demanded greater convenience and security, another innovation emerged: [social login](iam-protocols/social-login.md). This technology allows users to directly use their social media profiles, such as Facebook and Twitter, to authenticate themselves on non-social media platforms. The days of struggling with multiple usernames and passwords are gone; a single social media login suffices as an identity provider for all external services.
