# Introduction to IAM

Identity Access management is a branch of cybersecurity that aims to safeguard other services (web apps, mobile apps, ERPs, ...). It's main purpose is to grant specific access and permission to designated people while safeguarding the service integrity, confidentiality and availability.

Its origins are the simple login form created from the early websites. Entering the correct user and password associated, the website could give access based on your profile. That was the core principle. But this model soon showed his limitations. Imagine being a developer struggling to share code samples with hundreds of friends on a third party coding platform one by one. Manually entering all contacts seemed tedious. That's where third-party integrations came in with the [OpenID Connect](iam-protocols/openid-connect/) standard. Very quickly websites evolved to do so. There weren't just static pages anymore; websites are now interacting with services like Facebook, Google, and Twitter.&#x20;

Then, as a further evolution, technology improved to allow the same task to be done in less time. Meet [OAuth 2.0](iam-protocols/oauth-2.0/). This revolutionary protocol acts as a digital bridge between platforms, allowing certain services to request access only to specific user data belonging to another platform. [OAuth 2.0](iam-protocols/oauth-2.0/) fosters seamless integration and personalized experiences. No more entering, no more typing mistakes, or long lists to copy and paste. Users can authorize access with a single click, streamlining information sharing and enriching the online landscape.

But the story doesn't end there. As users demanded even greater convenience and security, another innovation emerged: [Social login](iam-protocols/social-login.md). This technology allowed users to directly employ their social media profiles (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to authenticate themselves on non-social media platforms. Gone were the days of struggling with multiple usernames and passwords; a single social media login sufficed as identity provider for all your external services.
