# Introduction to IAM

Identity Access Management is a branch of cybersecurity that aims to regulate access to other services (web applications, mobile applications, ERPs, ...) protecting them. Its main purpose is to grant specific access rights to certain people while ensuring the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the service.

IAM evolved from the simple login form on early websites. The need for efficient task execution within applications led to the development of federated services. This led to the introduction of [OAuth 2.0](iam-protocols/oauth-2.0), a protocol that allows services to request specific user data (e.g. contacts, general data, etc.) from another platform. This eliminates manual data entry and enables seamless integration and personalized experiences. Users can authorize access with a single click and can now interact with services such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, enhancing the digital ecosystem.

Up until this point, the website granted access based on the user's profile after entering the correct username and password. However, this model had its limitations. Users demanded a faster model that required fewer passwords and accounts.[OpenID Connect](iam-protocols/openid-connect/) was developed on top of OAuth2.0 to enable website and app authentication without having to manage password files. To achieve this, 'federated authentication' is used. In practice, users can now authenticate to a single IAM service called Identity Provider using their existing credentials.

But the story does not end there. As users' desire for more convenience and security, another innovation emerged: [social login](iam-protocols/social-login.md). This technology allows users to directly use their social media profiles, such as Facebook and Twitter, to authenticate themselves on non-social media platforms. The days of having to deal with multiple usernames and passwords are over; a single social media login is sufficient as an identity provider for all external services.
