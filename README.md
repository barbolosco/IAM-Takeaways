# IAM introduction

Identity Access management is a branch of cybersecurity that aims to safeguard other services (web apps, mobile apps, ERPs, ...). It's main purpose is to grant access at specific people specific services with specific permissions while keeping intact its integrity, confidentiality and availability.&#x20;

Its origins are the simple login form created in the early websites. Inserted the correct user and password associated, the website could give access access based on your profile. That was the core principle.\
\
Fast forward, and websites evolved. They weren't just static pages anymore; they interacted with services like Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Imagine being a developer struggling to share code samples with friends on a coding platform. Manually entering contacts seemed tedious. That's where third-party integrations came in. [openid-connect](iam-introduction/iam-protocols/openid-connect/ "mention")\

Then technology changed and all the job needed to be done in less time, meet [oauth-2.0](iam-introduction/iam-protocols/oauth-2.0/ "mention"). This revolutionary protocol acted as a digital bridge, allowing users to grant access to specific data from one platform to another, fostering seamless integration and personalized experiences. No more tedious copying and pasting â€“ users could authorize access with a single click, streamlining information sharing and enriching the online landscape.\

But the story doesn't end there. As users craved even greater convenience and security, another innovation emerged: [social-login.md](iam-introduction/iam-protocols/social-login.md "mention"). This technology allowed users to directly employ their social media profiles (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to authenticate themselves on non-social media platforms. Gone were the days of struggling with multiple usernames and passwords; a single social media login sufficed.
