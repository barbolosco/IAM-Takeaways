It provides provides user federation, strong authentication, user management, fine-grained authorization, SSO, OpenID Connect and SAML protocols, Identity Brokering and Social Login. Keycloak is currently licensed under Apache License 2.0 also it is an upstream project for Red Hat SSO, so if you are looking for something more enterprise-centered, you can check it.

Feature Highlights:

* **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to authenticate with Keycloak, rather than individual applications, without the need to re-enter credentials. This also applies to logout, Keycloak provides single-sign out, which means users only have to logout once to be logged-out of all applications that use Keycloak. This enhances the user experience and streamlines access management.
* **Standard Protocols**: Keycloak supports OpenID Connect, OAuth, and SAML protocols, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with a wide range of applications and systems.
* **LDAP & AD Integration**: Seamlessly connects with existing user directories such as LDAP and Active Directory, facilitating centralized user management and authentication.
* **Powerful RESTful API**: Provides a robust and flexible API accessible via REST endpoints, allowing developers to integrate Keycloak functionalities into their applications easily.
* **User Federation**: Enables the federation of user identities from external databases, enhancing scalability and simplifying user management across different systems.
* **Performance Efficiency**: Keycloak is lightweight, fast, and scalable, ensuring optimal performance even under heavy loads, thus providing a reliable identity and access management solution.
* **Client Adapters**: Simplify integration with various clients, allowing applications to seamlessly interact with Keycloak for authentication and authorization purposes.
* **Social Login Integration**: Offers easy integration with popular social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, allowing users to log in using their social media accounts. It's just a matter of selecting the social network you want to add, no code or changes to your application is required.&#x20;
* **Identity Brokering**: Keycloak can also authenticate users with existing OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 Identity Providers,, this is again just a matter of configuring the Identity Provider through the admin console.
* **Clustering**: Facilitates easy scalability and availability through clustering configurations, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
