# Our project

At ITS Mario Volpato, we embarked on a project fueled by two key objectives: to showcase our team's collaborative strengths and to build a website equipped with fundamental user management features. This endeavor served as a springboard for us to delve into the intricacies of website development, mastering both the frontend and backend aspects.&#x20;

Frontend developers Tommaso Barbolani and Nicol√≤ Tommasin were responsible for the user interface and visual presentation of the website. They used HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript to create a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience.

Backend developers Leonardo Paglia, Krizstian Ferrarese, and Mirko Campagnaro were responsible for the logic, data management, and server communication of the website. They used PHP, MySQL, and Python to build a secure and scalable platform.

Each team member brought their own unique skills and expertise to the project, and they worked closely together to ensure that the website met all of the requirements. The result was a well-designed and functional website that showcases the team's collective talents.
